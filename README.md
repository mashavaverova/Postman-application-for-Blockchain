This application is a basic blockchain system built with Node.js and Express.js. It provides REST API for interacting with the blockchain, allowing users to retrieve blockchain information, access specific blocks, and mine new blocks by submitting data. The mined blocks are stored in JSON files on the server. The application also includes logging and error handling features using middleware. 

It was created for educational purposes at Medieinstitutet as part of the Blockchain Developer course.
